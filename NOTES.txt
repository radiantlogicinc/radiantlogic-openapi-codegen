LOOK INTO SERDE TESTS WITH CLASSES THAT USE THESE ENUMS
UserFactorType
FactorTypeEnum


TESTS THAT I NEED

1. serde for discriminated unions, like super detailed
2. form-urlencoded requests
3. Different forms of auth
4. all http methods
5. multipart
6. serde for non-discriminated inheritance
7. Varied type schemas. OpenAPI CreateCompletionRequest.prompt, where the request prompt can be a string, string array, integer array, etc
8. Discriminated union where the discriminator is not properly mapped. OpenAI ItemResource and its sub-types is a good check for this.
