  title: Broken Discriminator Test
  description: >-
    A test spec for scenarios involving broken discriminated unions beyond what is available in
    actual specs. The actual specs have enough examples that handling broken discriminators is 
    necessary, however they don't provide enough opportunities to exercise all possible implications
    of the code change.
